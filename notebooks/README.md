# Telecom Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on telecom usage data, focusing on user activity and network performance. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, with visualizations and statistical techniques like PCA to explore relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:
- Aggregate and analyze data by user.
- Explore metrics like session durations, download/upload data volumes, and total data consumption.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Perform segmentation of users into deciles based on session durations.
- Provide insights through visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of important features.

## Files

- `data_analysis.py`: A Python script that processes the data, performs aggregation, and produces visualizations and statistical summaries.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive step-by-step analysis with visualizations.
- `Week2_challenge_data_source.csv`: The raw dataset used for analysis (make sure to place this file in the same directory as the scripts).

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them by using the following command in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
